# Consumptive-Water-Use-Refining-State-Water-Supply-Estimates-with-Discharge-and-Withdrawal-Data
Water is an essential natural resource that is utilized for a vast range of human and environmental purposes. Knowledge of available water supply and how it is being used is therefore crucial for resource management. Current assessments of water resources and trends rely heavily on analyzing water withdrawals. However, they do not account for water that is being returned to surrounding resources after use. Estimates of consumptive use, or water that is not returned to a water resource, can aid in the quantification of water availability. By examining historical consumptive use and current practices, more refined projections of water needs can be provided by local and State managers.  This study analyzes withdrawals and return flows from various users in Virginia from 2010-2017.  Different water use types and spatial scales are considered.
